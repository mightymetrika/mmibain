## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Used on.exit to ensure that the users par settings are reset when the function which used graphics::par(mfrow = c(2, 2)) is exited. This change is on lines 148 - 166 of the RepliCrisis.R file.  


## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
